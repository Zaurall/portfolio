I&#39;m Nurislam Zinnatulin, a first-year bachelor student at Innopolis University, and
			I&#39;m super stoked about programming and software development. I&#39;ve already dived into languages
			like Python, HTML, CSS, and got the hang of C, C++, and Java.</p> <p>I&#39;ve always had a thing for technology, and I can&#39;t get enough of it. I&#39;m constantly exploring
			new concepts and staying up-to-date with the latest trends in the industry. It&#39;s amazing how
			quickly I can grasp new ideas and put them into action.</p></article> <article class="about-aside svelte-1bpcbh9"><p>My goal is to make a real impact in the software development industry. I want to push
			boundaries and be at the forefront of emerging technologies. I&#39;m driven to create software
			solutions that shape the future and make a positive difference in people&#39;s lives.</p> <p>I&#39;m thrilled about the journey ahead, both as a student and a programmer. With my passion,
			determination, and a hunger for learning, I know I can achieve great things and leave my mark
			in this exciting field.</p> <p>Being a student at Innopolis University is a dream come true. I&#39;m surrounded by an incredibly
			dynamic learning environment that encourages creativity and innovation. I&#39;m always on the
			lookout for hackathons, coding competitions, and other extracurricular activities to challenge
			myself and keep growing.</p> <p>But it&#39;s not all about coding for me. I believe in a balanced lifestyle. I enjoy staying
			physically active, whether it&#39;s playing sports or going on outdoor adventures. And I&#39;ve also
			got a creative side, so you might find me pursuing hobbies like drawing or playing a musical
			instrument.</p> <p>As a programmer, I thrive on solving problems. It&#39;s like a puzzle that keeps me hooked. I love
			coming up with innovative and efficient solutions and making sure everything is pixel-perfect
			and user-friendly. And because I&#39;m comfortable with different programming languages, I can
			adapt to any project and work well with diverse teams.</p> <h2 class="about-aside-title svelte-1bpcbh9">experience</h2> <ul class="about-aside-list svelte-1bpcbh9"><li>python</li> <li>java</li> <li>cpp</li> <li>c</li> <li>html</li> <li>css</li> <li>a lit bit js</li></ul></article>`;return{c(){e=p("section"),e.innerHTML=a,this.h()},l(i){e=m(i,"SECTION",{class:!0,id:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),x(e)!=="svelte-igffte"&&(e.innerHTML=a),this.h()},h(){o(e,"class","about svelte-1bpcbh9"),o(e,"id","about")},m(i,s){I(i,e,s)},p:c,i:c,o:c,d(i){i&&d(e)}}}class U extends w{constructor(e){super(),k(this,e,null,B,$,{})}}const Z="/portfolio/_app/immutable/assets/predator-prey-visaliser.4c472e9a.png";function D(h){let e,a,i="Portfolio",s,n,g="Predator Prey visualizer",t,r,f,E,C,v,H="VibeChecker ... in process";return{c(){e=p("section"),a=p("h1"),a.textContent=i,s=_(),n=p("a"),n.textContent=g,t=_(),r=p("div"),f=p("img"),C=_(),v=p("p"),v.textContent=H,this.h()},l(y){e=m(y,"SECTION",{class:!0,id:!0});var l=z(e);a=m(l,"H1",{"data-svelte-h":!0}),x(a)!=="svelte-1iek1aq"&&(a.textContent=i),s=b(l),n=m(l,"A",{href:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),x(n)!=="svelte-1ewter4"&&(n.textContent=g),t=b(l),r=m(l,"DIV",{});var O=z(r);f=m(O,"IMG",{src:!0,alt:!0,class:!0}),O.forEach(d),C=b(l),v=m(l,"P",{"data-svelte-h":!0}),x(v)!=="svelte-1i6lbfr"&&(v.textContent=H),l.forEach(d),this.h()},h(){o(n,"href","https://github.com/Zaurall/AGLA-Assignments/blob/main/gnuplotPredatorPrey.cpp"),q(f.src,E=Z)||o(f,"src",E),o(f,"alt","predator-prey-visaliser"),o(f,"class","predator-prey-img svelte-7sey11"),o(e,"class","portfolio svelte-7sey11"),o(e,"id","portfolio")},m(y,l){I(y,e,l),u(e,a),u(e,s),u(e,n),u(e,t),u(e,r),u(r,f),u(e,C),u(e,v)},p:c,i:c,o:c,d(y){y&&d(e)}}}class J extends w{constructor(e){super(),k(this,e,null,D,$,{})}}function W(h){let e,a,i,s,n,g;return e=new V({}),i=new U({}),n=new J({}),{c(){S(e.$$.fragment),a=_(),S(i.$$.fragment),s=_(),S(n.$$.fragment)},l(t){P(e.$$.fragment,t),a=b(t),P(i.$$.fragment,t),s=b(t),P(n.$$.fragment,t)},m(t,r){j(e,t,r),I(t,a,r),j(i,t,r),I(t,s,r),j(n,t,r),g=!0},p:c,i(t){g||(A(e.$$.fragment,t),A(i.$$.fragment,t),A(n.$$.fragment,t),g=!0)},o(t){M(e.$$.fragment,t),M(i.$$.fragment,t),M(n.$$.fragment,t),g=!1},d(t){t&&(d(a),d(s)),T(e,t),T(i,t),T(n,t)}}}class R extends w{constructor(e){super(),k(this,e,null,W,$,{})}}export{R as component,Q as universal};
